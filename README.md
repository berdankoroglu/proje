Plants vs. Zombies is a simple game written with C++. In this game you will try to plant your
flowers by using sun points. In this simple version you have two plant cards:
    
    Sunflower: Creates the sun needed to plant more plants.
    Peashooter: Shoots peas at the zombies.

Sun points can be obtained by planting sunflowers and collecting the suns they created. Each
time you plant a flower the cost of that flower extracts from your sun points. Zombies appear on
random lines from the right of the game screen and have only melee attack. Therefore, you have
time to place your plants until they can attack. If any zombie reaches the left line of your screen
the game is over. The aim is to hold your defenses as long as possible. (You can check the
